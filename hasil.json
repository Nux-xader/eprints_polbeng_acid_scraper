        "abstract": "The disease covid-19 is caused by the coronavirus.\r\n\r\nCoronavirus is a virus that causes disease in humans and animals. Common symptoms of coronavirus infection include symptoms of acute respiratory distress such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Everyone in general is susceptible to being infected with the coronavirus.\r\nTherefore, it is very important to make an early diagnosis so that prevention or treatment can be carried out early. The diagnosis of the disease can be done directly by a doctor, but during a pandemic many people are worried and afraid if they are sick to come to the hospital to find information about their illness. From these problems, it can\r\nbe concluded that a mobile application for the early diagnosis of covid-19 is needed to help the community in diagnosing the early disease of covid-19. The mobile application for the early diagnosis of covid-19 was built using the forward chaining method. The forward chaining method is a method that includes variations of if for information and then for conclusions. By using the forward chaining method, the final result of the diagnosis for covid-19 can be known by the user.

        "abstract": "Smartphones are items that many teenagers have today. Smartphones always get significant developments from time to time. This can be seen by the number of teenagers who use smartphones. The positive thing about smartphones, of course, is that we can make it easier for us to do difficult jobs. In addition to having a positive impact, smartphones also have negative impacts such as disrupting the development of youth creativity which is owned by teenagers because they always play with smartphones so they don't focus on learning and reduce direct interaction with friends and family. From these problems, it can be concluded that an application is needed that can accommodate teenagers who want to sharpen their talents and interests by participating in events and jobs in the application. This application was built by applying the Prototyping Method which can assist teenagers in expressing their desire to get applications according to their needs and translate needs in the form of a model, namely Prototype. Evaluation of the prototype uses the SUS (Sytem Usability Scale) questionnaire to measure usability aspects according to the user's subjective assessment. This proves that involving users in the design process will produce a product that meets user needs."

        "abstract": "Motorcycle is one means of transportation that is often used by people in Indonesia. Due to the intensity of frequent use, it is not uncommon for motorcycles to experience minor or major damage, both to the engine part and the motor body. Usually, motorcycle service is carried out in automotive workshops, which are carried out by competent workers. Not everyone knows how much it costs to service a motorcycle, and the information obtained by the user is still not known by the user himself, to get information the user usually has to come to the motorcycle repair shop directly. Based on the above problems, an application for motorcycle service cost estimation is needed to make it easier for motorcycle owners to calculate the cost of each Android-based motorcycle service. The method used to perform the calculationIis the CostISignificant Model (CSM) which is an effective estimation method to provide an initial picture of costs."
